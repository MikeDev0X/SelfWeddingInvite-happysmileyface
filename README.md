# Miguel and Elisua 's wedding invitation
I'm happy to share that a year and eight months ago, I met the love of my life.  
Every day I wake up and try to be a better man for her.  
She has changed my life completely, and I couldn't be happier and more grateful.  

Anyways, here's a shoutout to programmers â€” never give up on love!

Best,  
*The groom*
